### Error messages that differ depending on the reason the field is invalid

## Project steps

- [x] On page load, the cursor appears in the "Name" field, ready for a user to type.
- [x] "Other job role" text field displays/hides when a user selects/deselects "Other" from the Job Role menu.
- [x] The "Color" field is disabled when the page loads, enables on theme selection, updates color selection
- [x] The total cost of selected activities correctly updates in the form when users select or deselect activities.
- [x] When the page loads, "Credit Card" is selected in the payment field, and the credit card section is the only payment section displayed in the form’s UI. The payment section updates correctly when the user changes the selected payment method in the drop down menu.
- [x] Form submission uses the submit event on the form element.
- [x] Form cannot be submitted (the page does not refresh when the submit button is clicked) until the form is valid
- [x] The activities have obvious focus state indicators when tabbing through the form’s inputs.
- [x] On submission, the validation error message, icon and color are displayed on invalid required fields
- [x] Code comments have been added to the js/script.js file. No unresolved errors appear in the console when the form loads or is interacted with.

### additional steps

- [x] The user is prevented from selecting two activities that are at the same day and time.
- [x] At least one required field validates user input in real time as the user interacts with the field.
- [x] At least one required form field provides validation error messages that differ depending on the reason the field is invalid.
- [x] Form fields that have real time validation and conditional error messages are detailed in the project’s README.me file.
